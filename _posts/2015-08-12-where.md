# Where is Ely Games Day?

**We meet The Old Dispensary on St Mary's Street in Ely**. The hall has ample space to play five to six games at once and is located near the centre of town.

## Is there somewhere I can park?

**Yes.** Car parking is free in Ely and there are several car parks close by. There is a car park opposite but it is short stay only. Barton Road is the nearest long stay car park and a short walk away from The Old Dispensary.
